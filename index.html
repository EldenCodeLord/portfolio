       <h3><em>About Me:</em></h3>
      <p>Hello! My name is Manuel. I have been a welder for approximately 6 years.
        I began my journey at <a href="https://www.epicodus.com/">Epicodus</a> last week!
        Been working hard as welder and came to the realization that I wanted something 
        more in life. Don't get me wrong, I loved <span class="highlight">welding</span>. It's just time for a change 
        and start a new career. Welcome to my life.
      </p>
